* In fill_bucket.js (use [http://localhost:9966/debug/index.html](http://localhost:9966/debug/index.html)), modify this line to add a random integer between 0 and 8192 instead of the x or y coordinate (or try both). Can we explain what this does? (Try zooming to the Croatian islands maybe, where there are lots of interesting polygons with good background contrast color). Zoom in and out; when and why does it change at intervals?

* In fill_extrusion_bucket.js (use [http://localhost:9966/debug/buildings.html](http://localhost:9966/debug/buildings.html)), comment out this line, and then change this to add only one instead of two (this is where we keep track of how many triangles we should have in the index array — this is more or less just bookkeeping). Can we explain what’s happening? Why do all the rooftops look intact? How could we make those look just as jagged?

* In circle_bucket.js (use [http://localhost:9966/debug/circles.html](http://localhost:9966/debug/circles.html)), here we add two triangles. What if we changed which indices we made the triangles out of? Change the first line to add triangles at index 0-2-3, then the second to add triangle 0-3-1. Can we explain this? Using this as a guide, how would you flip the pacman in the opposite direction?

* Text is rendered using a method called “signed distance fields (SDFs),” which are essentially rasterized single-channel representations of glyphs, where the value of a given pixel within a glyph is higher the more “inside” the glyph it is, and lower the further outside the glyph it is. We use this value to determine the opacity of a pixel within a glyph “quad” (rectangle) when we sample the SDF raster here. If you invert the alpha value here (alpha range is [0, 1]), how does this affect rendering?
